# ZXS_I2_kartridz

TODO !

Simple ROM cartridge for [Sinclair ZX Interface 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Interface_2).

In general this is updated design of Droy's [ZX Cart](http://trastero.speccy.org/cosas/droy/cartuchos/cartuchos_s.htm).

This version contains EEPROM chip W27C512 instead of 27*128 or 27*256. That is mainly because the W27C512 is more common and cheaper then 27128 and 27256. Search for W27C512 on the eBay. W27C512 also has a bigger capacity. The number 512 in the chip name means 512 Kib = 64 KiB. So one cartridge can contain up to four 16 KiB ROM files. Only one ROM file can be active at one time - which one is given by jumpers.
